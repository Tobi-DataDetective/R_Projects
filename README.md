This repository displays all my learnings and personnal projects using the R language

### What you will find here:
* [NorthWind Traders Application](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/R_Projects/tree/main/North_Traders_Application):
The northwind traders application is an application developeed using the MS Access, Rstudio along with Rshiny. The project involved connecting Rshiny directly to the MS Access NorthWind Traders database, then try to visualize the database in an Rshiny app, with various charts and plot built with the R language in R studio. Some model predictions where almso developed, such as the regression model.

* [Jumia Sentiment Analusis](https://github.com/Tobi-DataDetective/R_Projects/tree/main/jumia_sentiment_analysis):
Jumia is an ecommerce online platform which sells various items. This project was developed with the idea of trying to know the sentiments about the jumia customers. To do this, a twitter sentiment analysis was carried out to know what the people felt about the jumia platform. A connection was made with the twitter application and access was granted by using a twitter developer account. Data was then scraped using the various access keys given.

End SARS is a decentralised social movement, and series of mass protests against police brutality in Nigeria.
Similar to the Jumia sentiment analysis, data was scraped from the twitter using the hashtag #ENDSARS.
